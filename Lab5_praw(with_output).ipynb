I am looking to add more features to the script.  The monitor runs 24/7 that can catch restocks as soon as possible when stock is loaded onto a website, when a product page is available, and automatically, with the most minimal delay possible, send that information (The Item Loaded and the corresponding link) to to my discord or slack channel. I would also love for it to be configurable so that I am able to add in additional sites (100+ Shopify, adidas, Supreme and many more.) I would also love to be able to filter what gets shown on the Discord Channel (keywords possibly) as I don't want to get spammed with an obnoxious amount of information from stock loading on the websites I would like to track. I want to also add proxy’s so I won’t get banned from the site. This information is very important to users that resell sneakers and they need the most up-to-date information about a site loading stock on the backend that is available on the front end, or just having an early link to purchase from before everyone else.  If you want some more information, please DM me and I can provide more detailed sites and the file.\n",

      "Right. The law in Minnesota, for example, is written as it is unlawful to “be in immediate control over a vehicle with a BAC of 0.08 or higher.” The state Supreme Court has ruled that “immediate control” means in a position to exercise control over the vehicle, even if one has not yet begun doing so. Basically, the legislature intended to punish people for getting into their car while drunk. The concern being, it’s not unlikely for someone to climb in the backseat drunk, fall asleep, then wake up a few hours later thinking they’ve slept it off, when really they’re still too drunk to drive. \n",

If the state lawmakers wanted to change it, they could, so because  they haven’t, it’s probably safe to assume they think the Court got it right. Basically, if you’re going to be getting drunk, get a ride home. Full stop. \n",

      "Oh please, most cops will be the first ones to tell you they have a ridiculous amount of discretion when it comes to tickets and/or arrests. They enforce the law when and how they see fit, otherwise there would be no such thing as ‘getting off with a warning’ when you get pulled over. There are a shit ton of laws that don’t get enforced at all because cops know they won’t be prosecuted. \n",
